# kakoune-cheat

Experimental wrapper around [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh).

Colors are not supported (haven't yet figured out a way of rendering them).

You'll probably want to Ctrl-z and invoke the thing yourself anyway.

**Beware**: this plugin will automatically download the script at
"https://cheat.sh/:cht.sh" and execute it. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

Put the script (or clone this repo) in your autoload directory.

Single command: `:cheat`
